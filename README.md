# CircleCI monorepo

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/labs42io/circleci-monorepo/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/labs42io/circleci-monorepo/tree/master)  

Monorepo brings simplicity to the development process by having all code in one place, but raises the complexity of automated builds and deploy.  

For a relatively small monorepo it can be acceptable to have builds run for each service on every change.
However, if you a have a monorepo with a dozen of services/components, even the smallest change can introduce 
big delays in the CI process making it less efficient.  
  
This repository is an example of configuring CircleCI for a monorepo that has four services. 
The CircleCI configuration file has workflows defined per each service, that are triggered on every push only when the corresponding service has code changes.  

The sample services/components are `api`, `app`, `auth` and `gateway` all located in the subdirectory `/packages`.
For each service a CircleCI workflow with the same name is defined in `.circleci/config.yml` file.


## Important Disclaimer
This repository relies on CircleCI API v2 changes which are currently in [Preview release](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/api-preview-docs/tree/master/docs).
> Use of the v2 API as long as this notice is in the master branch (current as of June 2019) is done at your own risk and is governed by CircleCIâ€™s Terms of Service.

Additionally, it requires use of v2.1 configuration files as well as having [Pipelines](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/build-processing/) enabled. 

## How it works
Whenever a change is pushed to GIT, by default the `ci` workflow is triggered in CircleCI.  
The `ci` workflow consist of a single job `trigger-workflows`, which performs a `checkout` and executes the `circle_trigger.sh` bash script from the `.circleci` folder. The `circle_trigger.sh` bash script is then responsible for detecting which services contain code changes and trigger their corresponding workflow via CircleCI API 2.0.  

By convention, each service is located in a separate directory in `packages`.
For each service there should be a separate workflow defined in the `workflows` section in `.circleci/config.yml` configuration file. The workflow is matched by the service's name, which is the same as the directory name from `packages`.  

Each workflow is conditioned using a `when` clause, that depends on a pipeline parameter. The name of the parameter is the same as the name of the service.

### Change detection
Each workflow that corresponds to a service is triggered only when there are code changes in the corresponding service directory.
Below is a more detailed explanation of how it detects changes:

- The first step consists of finding the commit SHA of the changes for which the most recently CircleCI pipeline was triggered
  - Firstly it attempts to get the latest completed CircleCI workflow for current branch (together with the commit SHA)
  - If there are no builds for current branch (which is usually the case with feature branches),
    it looks for nearest parent branch and gets its commit SHA (using this [solution](https://gist.github.com/joechrysler/6073741))
  - If there are no builds for parent branch then it uses `master`
- Once it has the commit SHA of latest CircleCI workflow, it uses `git log` to list all changes between the two commits and flag those services for which changes are found in their directories.

## Before you start
To be able to trigger workflows via API, you need a CircleCI [personal API token](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-personal-api-token).  
The `circle_trigger.sh` script expects to find the token in `CIRCLE_TOKEN` environment variable.  
To prevent having the tokens published to git, you can use [project environment variables](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project).  

## How to configure new services/components
Once you add a new service/component to your monorepo you have to do the following steps:

- Add a directory in `packages/` that will be the root of your service/component. The name of the directory will be used as the name of the service/component.

- In `.circleci/config.yml` configuration file in `parameters` section add a corresponding parameter:

```yaml
parameters:
  my_awesome_service: # this should be the name of your service
    type: boolean
    default: false
```

- In `.circleci/config.yml` configuration file in `jobs` section define all the jobs that are need by current service/component.
To set the job's working directory to the directory of the service, you can use job parameter:

```yaml
build:
  parameters:
    package_name:
      type: string

  working_directory: ~/project/packages/<< parameters.package_name >>
  ...
  steps:
    - checkout:
        path: ~/project
```

- In `.circleci/config.yml` configuration file in `workflows` section add a corresponding workflow:

```yaml
workflows:
  when: << pipeline.parameters.my_awesome_service >> # the name of the parameter is the same as service name
    jobs:
      # add here the jobs used by this workflow
```

You have no restrictions on which jobs can be used by each workflow. It can be a service specific job, or a job reused by several workflows (services).
In case you have dependencies between jobs within a workflow, you can have a custom name for the job and then use that name as a requirement:

```yaml
service:
  ...
  jobs:
    - build:
        name: service-build # give a name for the `build` job used in current workflow
        package_name: service # name of the service passed as parameter; used to set the working directory
        ...
    - deploy:
        ...
        requires:
          - service-build # list as a dependency the `build` job from this workflow
```  
  
## Further notes

### Customizing the token
In CircleCI dashboard when viewing a job details you can see who triggered it. In this case it will be the team member whose API token is configured in `CIRCLE_TOKEN` environment variable (described above).  

It would be nicer to show there the name of the team member who made the code changes and triggered the workflow.
This allows to see then who triggered a specific job, and have a better integration with CircleCI notifications.  


Unfortunately CircleCI currently doesn't support user specific environment variables. One way to workaround it is to define in the CircleCI project
a variable for each team member by following a convention, and then use the built-in `$CIRCLE_USERNAME` to get the name of the variable:

```bash
TOKEN_NAME=CIRCLE_TOKEN_${CIRCLE_USERNAME} # this however will fail if username contain chars like `-`, '.' etc.
CIRCLE_TOKEN=${!TOKEN_NAME}
```

### Dependencies
Current example assumes all services are independent, so that changes made in one service doesn't require a CI build in another service. It doesn't cover the use case when a monorepo contains some shared libraries which are referenced as dependencies in other services. A change in a shared librabry might need all dependent services to be rebuilt or redeployed.  

This example could be developed further to handle service dependencies. One way to achieve this is to define a `.dependencies` file which represents the dependencies between services. Then, the `circle_trigger.sh` script should be adjusted to handle the changed services together with all other services that depend on them.
